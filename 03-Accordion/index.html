        <summary>Can I animate details/summary elements?</summary>
        <p>This used to be something that was impossible, but now thanks to modern CSS, it's actually pretty easy to do!</p>

        <summary>How is it possible?</summary>
        <p>There are a few different ways that you can do it. One of them is using <code>calc-size()</code>, which has some extra things you could do with it, but right now the easiest way is to use a combination of <code>interpolate-size: allow-keywords;</code> and <code>transition-behavior: allow-discrete</code>.</p>

        <summary>What about browser support?</summary>
        <p>Browser support isn't great as of the time of creating this demo, but it'll only get better from here. Also, it is a great <em>progressive enhancement</em>. This means that it won't break anything for people on older browsers, they just won't get the fancy animation you've created, while people on newer browser will get it!</p>

        <summary>What's the catch?</summary>
        <p>There is none! It's easy to do and it works great! I feel like that's too short, and I want to use this demo to show the animations and need a longer box to show it properly so here's a little bit of extra filler text lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi at ipsum dolor tempore impedit corrupti ad fugiat voluptate reiciendis voluptatum!</p>
